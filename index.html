          <p>
              <b>What are mountains?</b><br>
              A mountain is a large natural elevation of the Earth’s surface that rises prominently above the surrounding land, usually with steep sides and a peak (summit) at the top.<br>
              There are 14 mountains with their height crossing 8,000 meter. Among them 8 mountains are said to be in our home land, Nepal. This is the reason nepal is said to be "Country of Mountains".
